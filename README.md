# 100days_of_machinelearning_code
This is my first step towards Siraj Raval's #100daysofmlcode,I'll be updating it on daily basis. 
# day-1 
Doing CIFAR10 using 3 convolutional neural network
# day-2
Learned to do transfer learning with keras inception_resnet_v2 fixed some bugs in yesterdays CIFAR10 convolutional neural network.Here is the github link of dog-breed classification.https://github.com/pranavsuresh7/100days_of_machinelearning_code/tree/master/Dog_breed%20classification%20transfer%20learning . Need to upload some files in dog-breed classification which I'll upload tommorow.
# day-3 
Attended google developer group study jam initiated by keralaai(https://keralaai.in/)
Fixed some bugs on the workshop I attended today and learned to make tensorflow estimators from scratch.

# day-4
Made an image classifier which differentiates carrot and cuccumber.Used inceptionv3 model keras for transfer learning.
Link of repo-https://github.com/pranavsuresh7/carrot-or-cuccumber-inceptionv3
Studied some basics of YOLO-You Only Look Once algorithm for video processing.Will do more on YOLO comming days.
# day-5
Continuation of studying YOLO algorithm.
# day-6 
Started implementing YOLO algorithm with opencv,will add code repo within few days
# day-7 
Currently I'm using Intel AI cloud for computing,today just setted up google colab and watched some videos about video analysis.
# day-8
Not much progress,but I'm trying to create a video analyser with opencv and YOLO.So revised YOLO algorithm from deeplearning.ai.
# day-9 
Skipping programming for two days due to some non-technincal issues.
