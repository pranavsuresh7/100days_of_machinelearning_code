# 100days_of_machinelearning_code
This is my first step towards Siraj Raval's #100daysofmlcode,I'll be updating it on daily basis. 
# day-1 
Doing CIFAR10 using 3 convolutional neural network
# day-2
Learned to do transfer learning with keras inception_resnet_v2 fixed some bugs in yesterdays CIFAR10 convolutional neural network.Here is the github link of dog-breed classification.https://github.com/pranavsuresh7/100days_of_machinelearning_code/tree/master/Dog_breed%20classification%20transfer%20learning . Need to upload some files in dog-breed classification which I'll upload tommorow.
# day-3 
Attended google developer group study jam initiated by keralaai(https://keralaai.in/)
Fixed some bugs on the workshop I attended today and learned to make tensorflow estimators from scratch.
